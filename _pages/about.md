Welcome! I’m a PhD student in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at ETH Zurich, currently working on generative models and image editing under the supervision of <a href="https://da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann/" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Thomas Hofmann</a> and <a href="https://federicotombari.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Federico Tombari</a>. 

I earned my Master’s degree in Informatics from the Technical University of Munich, under the supervision of <a href="https://federicotombari.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Federico Tombari</a>. . Prior to that, I completed my B.Sc. at Boğaziçi University, where I conducted research on deep generative models under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X3ZFZ7AAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Ali Taylan Cemgil</a> and <a href="http://pinguar.org" target="_blank">Dr. Pinar Yanardag</a>. 

My research focuses on controllable image generation and editing, leveraging diffusion models and GANs. Recently, I have been working on improving precision and intuitiveness in image editing through techniques like attention regularization and contrastive learning, aiming to enhance fine-grained control over generative processes. I've developed methods like <a href="https://enis.dev/LIME/" target="_blank">LIME</a> for localized image editing and <a href="https://enis.dev/uip2p/" target="_blank">UIP2P</a> for unsupervised instruction-based editing. I'm particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with generative AI while making these powerful tools more accessible and controllable.
