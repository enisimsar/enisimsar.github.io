Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student in Informatics at ETH Zurich. I received my Informatics Master's degree from Technical University of Munich and B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul.

I have a keen interest in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, with a particular focus on image generation using generative adversarial networks and neural radiance fields. If you're interested, you can take a look at my  <a href="/publications">publications</a> and <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
