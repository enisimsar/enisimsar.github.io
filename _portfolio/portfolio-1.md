title: "Flatten the Curve: Social Distancing in the Wild"
excerpt: "In the time of a pandemic, it is important to keep a minimum distance from others to prevent the spread of disease. However, it is not easy to measure this distance in real life. To help this issue, we aim to build a visual assistant to track the own distance from others on the street.
<br/>
Assuming there is a user with a monocular mobile phone camera, webcam, or video we detect humans, estimate their depths from RGB image and build a warning mechanism.
