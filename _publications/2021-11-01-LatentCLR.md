title: "LatentCLR: A Contrastive Learning Approach for Unsupervised Discovery of Interpretable Directions"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Recent research has shown great potential for finding interpretable directions in the latent spaces of pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These directions provide controllable generation and support a wide range of semantic editing operations such as zoom or rotation. The discovery of such directions is often performed in a supervised or semi-supervised fashion and requires manual annotations, limiting their applications in practice. In comparison, unsupervised discovery enables finding subtle directions a priori hard to recognize. In this work, we propose a contrastive-learning-based approach for discovering semantic directions in the latent space of pretrained GANs in a self-supervised manner. Our approach finds semantically meaningful dimensions compatible with state-of-the-art methods.'
